## One-hop Upgrade Compatibility

Though the TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge}} installer supports one-hop upgrade from TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge_onehop_compatible_version}} or later versions, TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge}} upgrade instructions, in general, are for upgrading from TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge_previous}} (including update releases, if any) to TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge}}.
   
There is no support for one-hop upgrade from TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge_onehop_incompatible_version}} or earlier to TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge}}. You must upgrade your site to TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge_onehop_compatible_version}} or later and then upgrade to TeamForge {{site.data.identifiers.teamforge}}.
