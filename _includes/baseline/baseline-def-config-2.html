   1. Select the tracker type(s) from the **Tracker Type** drop-down list. These are the tracker types available in the project.
      {% include image.html file="baseline-tracker-type.png" %}
   2. Click **Add Filter(s)** and select the tracker type to set the required filters. The tracker type(s) that you have selected at step 1 are listed here.
      {% include image.html file="tracker-type-add-filter.png" %}       
      * _Attribute_ - Lists all the available attributes for the selected tracker type(s).
      * _Condition_ - Lists the conditions for the selected attribute type. 
      * _Value_ - Based on the selected attribute, either lists the values or provides the text box to enable you enter a suitable value.  

      Here's an example of how it appears after the filters are set. If you create the baseline at this point, it would create the baseline with completed user stories for the selected trackers.
      {% include image.html file="tracker-type-add-filter-2.png" %}
   3. Click **Add "AND" Condition** to concatenate more conditions to the filter criteria.
      {% include image.html file="baseline-tracker-type-add-condition.png" %}
   4. Repeat steps b and c until you've added the required filter criteria for Trackers.
   5. Click the cancel button ( {% include inline_image.html file="baseline-cancel.png" %}) against the filter criteria that you want to cancel.
   6. Select the planning folder. It is good enough that you select the parent/root planning folder to show all its child/sub folders. 
   {% include image.html file="baseline-planning-folder-filter.png" %}
   To see all the sub folders under the selected root planning folder, click "More".

   If you want to see the list of artifacts in the tracker(s) selected, click the view link ( {% include inline_image.html file="view-link.png" %}) in the **TRACKER/PLANNING FOLDER** section.

   You can narrow down the list by selecting the desired tracker and/or doing a keyword search in the preview pane.
   {% include image.html file="baseline-tracker-artifacts-preview.png" %}

   You can also do a keyword search by using the search ( {% include inline_image.html file="search-baseline-button.png" %}) on the preview pane.

      Tagging is one of the features of version control systems that lets you mark particular revisions (for example, a release version)â€”so that you can recreate a certain build or environment at a later point in time.

      * The **Select Tag** drop-down list shows all the tags you have for the selected Git or Subversion repository.
      * For Subversion repositories, the list of tags comes from the `/tags` directory of the repository.
      * For more information about SVN tags, see [Branching / Tagging](https://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-branchtag.html).
      * You can click the **View Tag** link to view the tag details.

   Select the server and repository from the **Server** and **Repository** drop-down lists, and select one or more packages from the **Select Packages** drop-down list.

   * The **Select Packages** drop-down list lets you search for packages using glob patterns. 
   * The **Select Packages** drop-down list loads the first 100 packages to start with. 
   * You must search for packages using file path glob patterns if you do not find what you are looking for.
   * For example, use the `com/**/*.jar` glob pattern to recursively search for JAR files in the `com` folder.
