## What is a News Component?

A news component is a way to get developing information to project members via a project page.

You can use a news component to maintain a journal or blog about your project, to announce milestones met, or to share information about a rapidly changing situation.

There is a single set of news posts for your project. If you put a news component on more than one project page, the same new posts will show on all of them.


## Post a News Item

To stay up to date, project can post regular news items on the project home page.

News items are posted and displayed on the respective project home page in which the news items are created and on the Digital.ai TeamForge home page.

1. Go to the home page of the project in which you want to post the news item.
   * From within the project, click **Project Home** in the project navigation bar.
   * From anywhere in TeamForge, choose the project from the **Project** menu in the TeamForge navigation bar.

2. In the **Project News** section, click **CREATE NEWS POST**.
3. On the **Create News Post** page, provide a title for the news item.
4. Write the news item in the **BODY**. The news item can be up to 40000 characters long, including spaces.
5. Click **Create**.

The news item shows up on the project home page and TeamForge home page immediately.

## Edit a News Item

To keep the project news in sync with the developments, modify the news items as and when required.

1. Find the project home page where you want to update the latest news.
   * From within the project, click **Project Home** in the project navigation bar.
   * From anywhere in TeamForge, choose the project from the **Projects** menu in the TeamForge navigation bar.
2. In the **Project News** section, click **Edit** next to the news items that you want to modify.
3. On the **Edit News Post** page, modify the title and/or the content of the news item.
4. Click **Save**.

The news post appears on the project home page, along with your name and the time at which you modified the post.

## Delete a News Item

It's a good idea to promptly delete a news item that is out of date or otherwise incorrect.

Deleting a news item from a project also deletes it from the TeamForge home page.

1. Find the project home page.
   * From within the project, click **Project Home** in the project navigation bar.
   * From anywhere in TeamForge navigation bar.
2. In the **Project News** section, click **Delete** next to the news item that you want to delete, and confirm that you want to delete the news item.

The news item is deleted.
