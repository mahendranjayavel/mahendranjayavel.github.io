summary: External public Git repositories can now be imported into TeamForge from the Code Browser UI. 
---

The new repository import feature lets you import an external, public Git repository into TeamForge using the Code Browser UI. 

{% include note.html content="This functionality was already available outside the UI, with CLI-based import (see [How can I import an existing Git repository into Gerrit?][gitgerrit-faqs.html#howtoimportgitrepo])." %}

To import an external Git repository into TeamForge:

1. Select **Source Code** from the **Project Home** menu.

2. In the list of the project repositories, click **Add**.

3. Select the **Import** tab.

   {% include image.html file="import-gitrepo-tab.png" %}

   Configure Advanced Repository Settings During Repository Creation/Import
   : The repository **Import** tab lets you import repositories by simply giving the repo a name and selecting the destination server. However, a **Settings** toggle button ia also available, which if selected, shows you all the advanced repository settingsâ€”thereby letting you configure the advanced repository settings at the time of repository import itself. 
   : This toggle button is not selected by default. 
   : {% include image.html file="20.0-scm-settingstoggle02.png" caption="The Import repository tab with the Settings toggle button selected" %}

4. Type the external public Git repository;s URL in the **IMPORT URL** field. 

   For example, if you want to import a repository named \"testwebhook\" from GitHub, simply type, `https://github.com/mkamaraj/testwebhook`. 

5. Type the username and password (to access the Git repository on the server where it resides). These are optional fields. 

6. Type a name, display name, and description for the repository. If you plan to use an SCM server that requires approval for new repositories, use the **Description** field to provide your reason for asking to create this repository.

7. Choose a code review policy from the **REPOSITORY CATEGORY** drop-down list. For more information on Gerrit code review policies, see [Control Your Code Review Policy][codereviewpolicy].

8. The **PROTECT HISTORY** check box is selected by default. You can disable it, if required. For more information, see [History Protection][historyprotect].

9. Choose values from the **GIT LFS ENABLED** and **MAX LFS OBJECT SIZE** drop-down lists. For more information, see [Set up LFS][setuplfs].

10. If you want each code commit to be associated with an artifact, select the **Required on commit** check box next to the **Association** field.

    {% include note.html content="One of the commit governance rules mandates that the artifact and the commit must be on the same TeamForge project." %}
    
    {% include image.html file="SCM-same_project_association.png" %}

11. For security reasons, you may want to restrict email notifications to the essential information. If so, select **Hide Details in Monitoring Messages**.

12. To index the repository and to make the repository searchable, select the **Repository content will be available in search results** check box.

13. Click **Import Repository**.

An email notification is sent to you, after successful import. Once the repository is imported, it gets added to the list of repositories.
