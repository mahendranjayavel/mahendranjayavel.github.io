For example, sometimes it can be useful to look at the status of a project by sharing a spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel or Google Spreadsheets.

 1. Click **TRACKERS** from the **Project Home** menu.

 2. On the **List Trackers, Planning Folders and Teams** page, click **PLANNING FOLDER**.

 3. On the **Summary** page, click the desired planning folder.

 4. From the **List Artifacts** page, click **SORT** or **RANK** as required. You can also select specific set of artifacts to be exported.

    {% include note.html content="When you export artifacts in the rank mode, the parent artifacts are listed along with the children as ranked in the **List Artifacts** page. Similarly, the sort order in the list view is retained in the exported list as well." %}

 5. Click **Export**.

 6. In the **Export Data** window, select an export format that you can import into the other application. For example, to use the data in a spreadsheet program, select `CSV`.

 7. Move the fields you are interested in from the **AVAILABLE COLUMNS** list to the **SELECTED COLUMNS** list, then click **Export** to complete the process.
