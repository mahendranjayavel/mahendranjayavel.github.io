summary: A registered Digital.ai TeamForge user can ask to be a member of a project. As the project administrator, it's up to you to approve or reject such requests.

When a Digital.ai TeamForge user submits a request for project membership, the request is placed in the **User Membership** section of the **Project Administration** page, pending approval by a project administrator. The request is also displayed in the **Items Pending My Approval** section of each project administrator's **My Page**.


 1. Click **PROJECT ADMIN** from the **Project Home** menu.

 2. On the **Project Admin Menu**, click **User Membership**, then click the _PENDING REQUESTS_ tab.

 3. Under **Users Requesting to Join Project**, select the user you want to approve or reject.

    * Click **Approve** to approve the request and add the user to the project.

    * Click **Reject** to deny the request.

 4. To view details about the user or add a comment before approving or rejecting the request, click the user name. This is optional.

The user receives an email notification when the request is approved or rejected.
