Your project can be in one or more project categories.

 1. Click **PROJECT ADMIN** from the **Project Home** menu.

 2. On the **Project Admin Menu**, click the _PROJECT CATEGORIZATION_ tab. A list of all the categories that the project belongs to is displayed.

 3. Click **Add**. The **Select Category** window shows all the available project categories.

 4. If you find a project category that your project should be in, select that category and click **Add**.


Your project is now a member of the selected project category. You can repeat this process to add your project to any number of project categories.
