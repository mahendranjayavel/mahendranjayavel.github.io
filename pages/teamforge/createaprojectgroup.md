summary: To begin controlling multiple projects at one go, create a project group.
---
To manage two or more independent projects, create a project group in TeamForge. Similar to projects, a project group provides the platform for sharing project members, roles and permissions across a group of projects. With some well planned settings, you can manage several of your projects and also effectively control the project members accessing each project.

To begin managing your several projects together, create a project group in TeamForge.

{% include note.html content="When you create a project group, you are granted administration rights for the group and will be able to perform actions such as adding or removing a project from the group. You will be listed as an administrator in the group's Project Group Details. (Site administrators are exempt from this, since they can perform all actions on the site without requiring specific roles)." %}

1. Go to **My Workspace > Admin**.
2. Click **PROJECT GROUPS** from the **Projects** menu.
   The existing project groups are listed here.
3. To create a new project group, click **Create Project** Group.
4. On the **Create Project Group** page, write a name and description for the project group. The project group name must be unique, however, it can be the same as any of the projects.
   
   The project group is created.

   In your Project Group page, you can add projects, add project group members or specify roles for the project group.

   {% include tip.html content="You can always come back to this page later to specify projects, users or roles that affect your project group." %}
