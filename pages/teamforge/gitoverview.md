summary: TeamForge supports integration with Git, a distributed version control tool powered by Gerrit.
---

Although Git is the worldâ€™s leading distributed version control system, the enterprise has been slow and tentative in its adoption. Concerned with security breaches, compliance violations and lack of governance, many organizations have chosen to take a "wait and see" approach. With TeamForge, Git is ready for the enterprise. TeamForge lets you realize all the benefits of Git while ensuring the security, governance and manageability your business demands. With TeamForge, you can even manage Git and Subversion together, within each individual project.

Gerrit is an open source code review system designed to work with Git. Gerrit supports various access control mechanisms. The TeamForge Git integration uses Gerrit as a vehicle to bring TeamForge project roles and permissions into Git.

## Install or Upgrade TeamForge-Git Integration

You can install Git on the TeamForge Application Server or on a separate server dedicated for SCM. For more information about installing and upgrading Git, see TeamForge install and upgrade instructions.

You can also read the [CollabNet blog posts on Git](http://blogs.collab.net/git) and follow the latest developments in the Digital.ai TeamForge-Git integration space.

## Add Git as a Linked Application

Once you have installed Git, you can add Git as a linked application on your TeamForge site.

{% capture cap1 %}
{% include inline_image.html file="status-success-small.png" %} In TeamForge 7.2 and later versions, installing Git for the first time creates a site-wide linked application automatically.<br><br>
<!-- {% include inline_image.html file="status-success-small.png" %} In TeamForge 8.0 and later versions, in addition to a site-wide linked application, a project-wide linked application is also created for projects in TeamForge that have at least one CVS repository.<br><br> -->
{% include inline_image.html file="status-success-small.png" %} However, this behavior can be controlled by the `teamforge.createTFProjectLinkedApps` Gerrit config (`gerrit.config`) property.
{% endcapture %}
{% include callout.html type="primary" content=cap1 %}

1. Set up the URL `http://<TEAMFORGEHOSTNAME>/gerrit/sso/`.
   {% include note.html content="The `/` at the end of the URL matters. Make sure you have it." %}
2. For instructions on setting up a site-wide linked application in TeamForge, see [Create a Site-wide Linked Application][externalapplications.html#linkedapps]. 
   
   Here's an example for Git:
   
   {% include image.html file="gerrit-linkedapp-80.png" %}
   
   A link for Git is added to the More menu in your TeamForge navigation bar.

   {% include image.html file="gerrit-linkedapp-80-1.png" %}

   Clicking **Git** displays the Git console in the main TeamForge window.
