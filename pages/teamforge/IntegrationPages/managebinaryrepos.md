## Create a Binary Artifact Repository

{% include note.html content="Before you can create a repository for binary artifacts, a site administrator must set up TeamForge-Nexus integration and add one or more binary servers to your TeamForge site." %}

1. Click **BINARIES** from the **Project Home** menu.
2. Select **Create Nexus3 Repository** from **Create Repository** drop-down list. You are redirected to Nexus 3 application.
   {% include important.html content="TeamForge-Nexus 3 integration does not support creating a repository from within TeamForge **Binaries** page." %}
3. Create the repository from within the Nexus 3 application.

The binary repository is created.

## Link Binary Artifact Repository to Project

You can link existing binary artifact repositories, if any, to your project.

{% include note.html content="Earlier, only project admins can link the repository to a project. From TeamForge 18.2, any user with the permission to create repositories can link the repository to a project." %}

1. Click **BINARIES** from the **Project Home** menu.
2. Click **Link Existing Repository**.
3. Select a repository from the list of binary repositories and click **Link to Project**.


## Delete a Binary Artifact Repository

You must have the required permission to delete binary repositories. As a project admin, you can use the delete option only to unlink the repository from a project. If you want to delete a repository from the Nexus, login as a Nexus admin.

1. Click **BINARIES** from the **Project Home** menu.
2. In the list of the repositories, select the repository you want to delete and click **Delete**. The following confirmation message appears: 
   ```shell
   This repository will no longer be accessible. Your site administrator can relink it later. Are you sure you want to unlink this repository?
   ````
3. Click **OK** to delete.

The repository is deleted.

{% include note.html content="This deletion dissociates the repository from your project; only the Site Admin can reinstate the repository." %}
