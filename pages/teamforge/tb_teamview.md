summary: The Team view in Task Board provides an option to filter backlog items for a specific team within the selected planning folder.
---
This team's view of artifacts applies only to backlog items. When you filter and view the backlog items for a specific team, the tasks (if any) within the filtered backlog items are also displayed in the relevant status swimlanes. However, you cannot filter tasks alone for a team.

You can move the artifact cards between swimlanes. If the artifacts are workflow configured, appropriate error messages are displayed when a workflow rule is broken.

 1. Click **TRACKERS** from the **Project Home** menu.

 2. In the **List Trackers, Planning Folders and Teams** page, click **TASK**. A Task Board for the current project context is displayed.

 3. Select a planning folder from the drop-down list. All the backlog items and their tasks in the selected planning folder are displayed.

 4. Select a team from the **Select a Team** drop-down list.

    {% include note.html content="If there are no teams created for a project, then the `Select a Team` drop-down list is not displayed at all." %}

    All the backlog items and their tasks in the selected team are displayed.
