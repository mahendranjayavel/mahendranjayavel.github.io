summary: To enable project members to allocate hosts from a public cloud in your Lab Management site, you must turn on a setting to allow the inclusion of public clouds in your project.
---

1. In **Administration > Projects**, click **Edit** for your project.

2. Turn on the **Allow Public Clouds** setting. If you want to be able to control the hosts your project members can select from, turn this setting OFF. In this case, your project members can only select systems from a cloud your project explicitly owns. Your project's **Allowed Clouds** page lists all the available clouds from which project members can allocate hosts.

{% include note.html content="If you think that your project needs more systems than those available from a cloud, you need to ask the cloud administrator for your site to increase this number." %}
