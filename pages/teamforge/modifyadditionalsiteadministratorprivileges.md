summary: If restricted site administrators need to do things that are not allowed by a role you have assigned to them, you may need to change the permissions associated with that role.
---
When you edit a role, all restricted site administrators with that role get the updated permissions automatically.
 {% include tip.html content="You may have prevented the access permission into private projects earlier. Now you can modify the restriction or change other relevant permissions." %}

 2. Click **Roles** from the **Projects** menu.
