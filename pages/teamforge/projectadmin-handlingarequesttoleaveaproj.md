summary: A TeamForge user who wants to leave a project must submit a request. The project administrator can approve or reject the request.
---

A request to leave is placed in the **User Membership** section of the **Project Administration** page, pending approval by a project administrator. The request is also displayed in the **Items Pending My Approval** section of each project administrator's **My Page**.

1. Click **PROJECT ADMIN** from the **Project Home** menu.
2. On the **Project Admin Menu**, click **User Membership**, then click the _PENDING REQUESTS_ tab.
3. Under **Users Requesting to Leave Project**, select the user whose request you want to approve or reject.
   * Click **Approve** to approve the request and remove the user from the project.
   * Click **Reject** to deny the request.
4. To view the user details or add a comment before approving or rejecting the request, click the user name. This is optional.
 
The user receives an email notification when the request is approved or rejected.
