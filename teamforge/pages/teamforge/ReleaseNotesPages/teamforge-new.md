## File Releases (FRS)â€”Download Count for Files

TeamForge 22.1 lets you track the number of downloads for each file under **File Releases> Package > Release** within the FRS module. This helps you understand the number of downloads and then take an informed decision on whether to retain or delete a file based on the number of downloads.

## Fixed in Release and Reported in Release as Multi-select Fields

* You can now select multiple releases for the **Fixed in Release** and **Reported in Release** fields.
* Projects often have several maintenance/release branches and if there is an issue, it might affect one or more releases (branches), and the fix would typically apply to several releases. Having the ability to select multiple releases helps with the clear definition of the release content.

## Tracker Dependency Updates Within Change Log  

* Artifact dependency updates such as adding or removing parent or child artifact are now added to the artifact's **Change Log** tab.
* The dependency change log includes information such as the user who updated the dependency, the time when the update was done, and a brief description of the old and new dependency values.
* This change log can come in handy for auditing purposes.
