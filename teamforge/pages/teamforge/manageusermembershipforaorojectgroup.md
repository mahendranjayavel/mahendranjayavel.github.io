{% include tip.html content="You could be either a site administrator or a project administrator, but you must have the project groups administration permissions to manage projects as a group." %}

If you have just created your project group, you might already be on the Project Group Details page. Skip the first three steps in that case.

1. Go to **My Workspace > Admin**.
2. Click **PROJECT GROUPS** from the **Projects** menu.
   The existing project groups are listed here.
3. Click your project group. The **Project Group Details** page appears.
4. From the left navigation pane, click the **User Membership** link to add users to the project group.
5. On the **PROJECT GROUP MEMBERSHIP** tab, click **Add**.
6. On the **Add User** page, find the users you want by one of these methods:
   * Under **Search for Users**, filter the list of site users eligible to join this project group. You can filter by full or partial name or user name.
     {% include note.html content="Search text is not case-sensitive." %}
   * Browse the list of registered users on the site. Sort them by name, user name, email address or membership status.
     {% include note.html content="If a site has a great many users, you must filter them first to narrow down the list. This helps avoid slowing down the system." %}
7. Select the users you want to add.
8. Under **Assign Roles (Optional)**, select the roles you want the users to have.
   You can select any available global project role or role created just for this project.

   {% include tip.html content="If you prefer, you can skip this step and assign roles later on." %}
9. Save your changes.
10. Click **Save** to return to the **Project Group Membership** page.
11. Click **Save and Add More** to keep adding users.
    The selected users are granted membership to the project group.

    If you add a user who may not need to be a member of the project group, you can select the user from the **Project Group Membership** page and click **Remove** to remove the user's membership.
