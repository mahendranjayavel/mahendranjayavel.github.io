If you have just created your project group, you might already be on the Project Group Details page. Skip the first three steps in that case.

1. Go to **My Workspace > Admin**.
2. Click **PROJECT GROUPS** from the **Projects** menu.
   The existing project groups are listed here.
3. Click your project group. The **Project Group Details** page appears.
4. On the **Project Group Details** page, click **Add** to associate your projects with the project group.
   A list of projects appears.
   {% include tip.html content="You can only add the projects for which you are the project administrator." %}
5. From the **PROJECT** list, select the projects and click **Add**.
   The selected projects are added to the project group.
6. If you add an irrelevant project to the group, you can select it from the **Project Group Details** page and click **Remove** to remove it from the project group.

   {% include tip.html content="You can always come back to this page later to add more projects, specify users or roles that affect your project group." %}
