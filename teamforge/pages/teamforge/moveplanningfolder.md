summary: A planning folder's position may reflect scheduling changes in relation to the work contained in other planning folders.
---

For example, when plans change and the work represented in a later planning folder moves ahead of an earlier planning folder, move the folders around in the hierarchy to reflect the new relationship.

When you move a document folder, any documents and subfolders that it contains are also moved to the destination folder. Before promoting a planning folder to a higher level in your hierarchy of folder, make sure its member artifacts (and its member's parent artifacts, if any) are all assigned to the same planning folder, or to a planning folder that belongs to the same folder hierarchy.

 1. Click **TRACKERS** from the **Project Home** menu.

 2. In the planning folder tree, find the foler that you want to move. Click the title to select it.

 3. Choose **Cut** from the **EDIT** menu.
 
 4. In the folder tree, find the folder into which you want to move the selected folder. Click the title of the folder to select it.

    {% include note.html content="You can move a folder into the root folder or into any other folder, as long as no member artifact ends up  having a parent belonging to a higher-level folder in the same tree." %}

 5. Choose **Paste** option from the **EDIT** menu. The folder is moved to the destination folder.
