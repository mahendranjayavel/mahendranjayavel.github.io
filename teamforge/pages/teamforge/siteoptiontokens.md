summary: Here's a list of TeamForge `site-options.conf` tokens and configuration information.
---

## TeamForge Services and Domain Configuration Tokens

See [TeamForge Services and Domain Configuration Tokens][siteconfigtokens].

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## ACTIVITY_LINKS_CUSTOMIZATION
When this token is set to `true`, the **TeamForge Activity Chart** and the **Most Active Projects List** do not appear on the main page before the user logs in.

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: false
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## ADHOC_QUERY_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT {#ADHOC_QUERY_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT}
Specifies the connection timeout for Adhoc query. 

**Values**: Integer

**Default**: 15000

{% include installupgrade/teamforgereload.html %}
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## ADHOC_QUERY_RESULTS_LIMT {#ADHOC_QUERY_RESULTS_LIMT}

Specifies the results limit for Adhoc query.

{% include installupgrade/teamforgereload.html %}
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## ADMIN_EMAIL
The `ADMIN_EMAIL` token specifies a valid email address for the site administrator. The mail account specified must be hosted on a separate server outside of the TeamForge Application Server. The `SYSTEM_EMAIL`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and `JAMES_POSTMASTER_EMAIL` tokens can specify the same address.

{% include important.html content="In TeamForge 6.x (and later), the sender name and address for system-generated emails is taken from the value of the `SYSTEM_EMAIL` token. Therefore, changing the admin user's full name or email address does not affect the sender details of system-generated emails. This is different from TeamForge 5.x, in which the sender name and address for system-generated emails is derived from the admin user's full name and email address." %}

**Values**: Email address specification

**Default**: `root@{\__APPLICATION_HOST\__}`
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## ALLOW_CASE_INSENSITIVE_LOGIN {#allowcaseinsensitivelogin}

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: false
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## ALLOWED_HOSTS {#ALLOWED_HOSTS}

This token is used to specify the list of allowed hostnames. This token works only if the `site-options.conf` token [SECURE_REDIRECTS][siteoptiontokens.html#SECURE_REDIRECTS] is set to _true_. When the HOST header is not equal to `NODE_HOSTNAME` or `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, then it redirects to the custom 400 error page.

**Values**: xxx.com yyy.com zzz.com (multiple hosts)

**Default**: none

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## ALLOW_NO_PASSWORD_ON_USER_CREATION

The `ALLOW_USERNAME_IN_PASSWORD` token, when set to true, allows users to set a password that includes the string that they use for their user name on the site.

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: true
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## APPLICATION_LOG_DIR
The `APPLICATION_LOG_DIR` token specifies the directory to which the application writes its log files. 

**Values**: Path specification

**Default**: `/opt/collabnet/teamforge/log/apps`
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## APPROVE_NEW_USER_ACCOUNTS {#APPROVE_NEW_USER_ACCOUNTS}
The `APPROVE_NEW_USER_ACCOUNTS` token specifies whether a site administrator must approve the requests to join the site.

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: true
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## ARTIFACT_DESC_EDITOR
The `ARTIFACT_DESC_EDITOR` token allows you to choose the type of text that can be used for artifact description using the editor tool.

**Values**: Plain Text

**Default**: Plain Text
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## ARTIFACT_LIST_LIMIT
The `ARTIFACT_LIST_LIMIT` token specifies the maximum number of artifacts displayed in and exported from the **Planned Tracker Artifacts** tab available in **File Releases**.

**Values**: Integer

**Default**: 5000
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## AUTO_DATA
TeamForge 7.1 and later support automatic password creation. Once you turn on automatic password creation, the `AUTO_DATA` token is auto-generated by the installer during runtime recreation.

{% include warning.html content="The `AUTO_DATA` token is not a user-editable site options token. Do not modify this token manually." %}

The following password-related `site-options.conf` tokens can have the passwords automatically created if set to *$auto$*. When set to *$auto$*, the passwords for the tokens are randomly generated, encrypted and stored in the `AUTO_DATA` token that is added automatically to the `site-options.conf` file during runtime recreation.

```shell
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$auto$
DATABASE_READ_ONLY_PASSWORD=$auto$
REPORTS_DATABASE_PASSWORD=$auto$
REPORTS_DATABASE_READ_ONLY_PASSWORD=$auto$
ETL_SOAP_SHARED_SECRET=$auto$
JAMES_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$auto$
BDCS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$auto$
MIRROR_DATABASE_PASSWORD=$auto$
SCM_ADMIN_PASSWORD=$auto$
````

{% include warning.html content="As this `AUTO_DATA` token is auto-generated and managed by the TeamForge installer, do not modify this token manually during TeamForge upgrades. When you upgrade TeamForge, you must copy this token intact (along with its value) from the old `site-options.conf` file to the upgraded site's `site-options.conf` file, before recreating the runtime. This applies to all the servers in a distributed set up (copy the AUTO_DATA token and its value to all the servers)." %}

**This feature is enabled by default**. You can, however, override any of the above password-related tokens with the password of your choice.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BASELINE_BULKDATA_BATCHSIZE {#BASELINE_BULKDATA_BATCHSIZE}

**Default**: 20
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BASELINE_CACHE_ENABLED {#BASELINE_CACHE_ENABLED}
This token is used to control the caching of Binaries (Nexus) within Baselines. The default value is _false_.

Loading a large number of Nexus repositories while creating baslines or baseline definitions can last for longer durationsâ€”typically slowing down the entire process itself. 

By enabling caching for baselines and setting up webhooks for the Nexus repositories, you can quickly load the list of Nexus repositories available to filter when you create or modify baselines or baseline definitions.

For more information, see [Enable Caching for Baselines][binary-repo-caching].

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: false
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BASELINE_CACHE_EXPIRE_TIME {#BASELINE_CACHE_EXPIRE_TIME}

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BASELINE_LOG_LEVEL {#BASELINE_LOG_LEVEL}
Specifies the log level for baseline service. The default log level is INFO.

**Values**: INFO, WARN/WARNING, ERROR, PANIC, DEBUG, FATAL 

**Default**: INFO 
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BASELINE_LOG_MAX_AGE {#BASELINE_LOG_MAX_AGE}

Specifies the maximum age of baseline log file. Maximum configurable value is 28 days.

**Values**: Integer (in days)

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BASELINE_LOG_MAX_BACKUP {#BASELINE_LOG_MAX_BACKUP}

**Default**: 9192
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BASELINE_PSQL_MAX_CONN {#BASELINE_PSQL_MAX_CONN}
Maximum number of connections to baseline database.

**Values**: 1 - 100

**Default**: 100
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BCC_MAIL_BATCH_SIZE

Set the `ENABLE_BCC_MONITORING` token to **true** and then depending on your site's requirements, you can set the value of this `BCC_MAIL_BATCH_SIZE` token to configure the number of monitoring emails delivered in a single delivery.

When a work item such as an artifact or discussion is updated, instead of sending separate monitoring emails to all monitoring users, you can now choose to have just one monitoring email sent with all monitoring users added to the BCC. This reduces the load on the email server and results in faster email delivery. You must enable this feature by setting `ENABLE_BCC_MONITORING` to **true** and then, depending on your site's requirements, you can optimize the value of this `BCC_MAIL_BATCH_SIZE` token to increase or decrease the number of emails delivered in a single delivery.

**Values**: Integer

**Default**: 100

This token was added in TeamForge 7.2.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## BINARY_SETUP_TYPE

Set this token appropriately to have the binary application installed the way you want (as part of the TeamForge installation or upgrade).

TeamForge 8.0 and later support integration with Nexus OSS, an open source repository manager for binary artifacts. By default, the TeamForge installer installs a binary application (referred to as the `binary app` hereinafter), which is essentially a launching pad for all binary integrated applications such as Nexus OSS. Once this binary app is installed as part of TeamForge installation, you can integrate your Nexus servers and repositories with TeamForge.

Though the binary app is installed by default with TeamForge, you can change the value of this site option token, `BINARY_SETUP_TYPE`, to skip binary app installation altogether. You can also have this token configured to have the binary app installed and rolled out for all projects (both existing and new projects to be created) or only for new projects to be created or for select projects on a need basis.


**Values**:
* all: Binary app is installed and available for all projects.
* new: Binary app is installed and available for new projects only.
* manual: Binary app is installed at a site level and project administrators can add it to select projects on a need basis.
* none: TeamForge installer skips the binary app installation altogether.

**Default**: new

This token was added in TeamForge 8.0.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BINARIES_ENDPOINT_URL {#BINARIES_ENDPOINT_URL}

Specifies the URL of Nexus binaries server.

**Values**: Server URL

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## BROWSER_NO_CACHE {#browsernocache}

`BROWSER_NO_CACHE` is a new token added to `runtime-options.conf` file to enable or disable browser caching in TeamForge for better application performance. By default, the token is set to `false` in `runtime-options.conf` file. To disable browser caching, set the value to _true_ in `site-options.conf` file.

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: false

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## COMPARE_LIMIT {#COMPARE_LIMIT}

Maximum number of records allowed while comparing baselines. Only up to 10,000 records are allowed.

**Values**: 1 - 10000

**Default**: 10000
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DATABASE_NAME

The `DATABASE_NAME` token specifies the name of the site's database.

**Values**: Alphanumeric string

**Default**: teamforge
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## DATABASE_PASSWORD

The `DATABASE_PASSWORD` token is the password for the Unix user that is authorized to read from and write to the site's database.

**Values**: Alphanumeric string

**Default**: $auto$
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## DATABASE_SSL {#DATABASE_SSL}

To prevent your data from being exposed in a readable format on the network, use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt the network traffic between the Application and the Database servers. The `DATABASE_SSL` token turns SSL `on` or `off` on sites that use a dedicated operational database server. 

You can have the TeamForge PostgreSQL database server run with SSL enabled by setting `DATABASE_SSL=on`. Once SSL is turned on, the PostgreSQL server listens to both normal and SSL connections on the same TCP port and negotiates with any connecting client on whether to use SSL or not.

To start in SSL mode, the server certificate and private key files must exist. These files are, by default, supposed to be named `server.crt` and `server.key`, respectively, in the database server's data directory. 

Use the `POSTGRES_SSL_CERT_FILE` and `POSTGRES_SSL_KEY_FILE` tokens to configure the location of the `server.crt` and `server.key` files of the TeamForge PostgreSQL database server respectively.

For example,
```shell
DATABASE_SSL=on
POSTGRES_SSL_CERT_FILE=/var/ops/ssl/dbserver.crt
POSTGRES_SSL_KEY_FILE=/var/ops/ssl/dbserver.key
````

Use the `POSTGRES_BASELINE_SSL_CERT_FILE` and `POSTGRES_BASELINE_SSL_KEY_FILE` tokens to configure the location of the `server.crt` and `server.key` files of the TeamForge Baselines PostgreSQL database server respectively.

For example,
```shell
DATABASE_SSL=on
POSTGRES_SSL_CERT_FILE=/var/ops/ssl/dbserver.crt
POSTGRES_SSL_KEY_FILE=/var/ops/ssl/dbserver.key
POSTGRES_BASELINE_SSL_CERT_FILE=/var/ops/ssl/baselinedb-server.crt
POSTGRES_BASELINE_SSL_KEY_FILE=/var/ops/ssl/baselinedb-server.key
````

**Values**: `on` or `off`

**Default**: `off`
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DATABASE_TYPE

The `DATABASE_TYPE` token specifies the type of database in which the TeamForge site's data is stored.

**Values**: postgresql or oracle

**Default**: postgresql
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DATABASE_USERNAME

The `DATABASE_USERNAME` token specifies the Unix user that is authorized to read from and write to the site's database.

**Values**: Alphanumeric string

**Default**: teamforge

**Comments**: For some advanced operations, you may need to log into the database as the database user. However, under normal conditions only the TeamForge site process itself needs to access the database.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DEFAULT_LOCALE

The `DEFAULT_LOCALE` token specifies the language in which automated email messages from the site are generated.

**Values**:

**Default**: en
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

**Values**: private, gated, public

**Default**: private
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DISABLE_CREATE_INTEGRATION_SERVERS {#disable_create_integration_servers}

The `DISABLE_CREATE_INTEGRATION_SERVERS` token specifies whether the creation of new SCM integrations is allowed.

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: false

**Comments**: When this token is set to its default value of `false`, you can add SCM integration servers to your TeamForge site. Also, the **Discover Subversion Edge Servers** option, which enables you to find and connect to Subversion Edge servers on your LAN, is available.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DISABLE_REMOTE_PUBLISHING

Publishing repository, like the branding repository, is one of the default repositories that's created automatically when a TeamForge project is created and is intended to contain publicly-consumable files. However, site administrators can toggle access to Publishing Repositories and restrict access based on defined RBAC.

For more information on Publishing Repository, see [What is a Publishing repository? How does it work?][faqs.html#publishingrepository]. This token is set to false by default, meaning the Publishing Repository is publicly accessible.

If set to `true`:

* The Publishing Repository is stripped of its public access and behaves like any other Subversion repository with RBAC applied to it.
* Project Administrators can no longer view or modify the **PROJECT HOME OPTIONS** (see Create a custom project home page).

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: false
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DISABLE_USER_SELF_CREATION {#DISABLE_USER_SELF_CREATION} {#DISABLE_USER_SELF_CREATION}

The `DISABLE_USER_SELF_CREATION` token restricts users from creating their own accounts on the TeamForge home page.

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: true
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DISCUSSION_ADD_HEADERS

The `DISCUSSION_ADD_HEADERS` token allows you to add custom headers to the emails posted in the forum.

**Values**:
You can choose to add or remove headers by specifying the particular information you want to be added or dropped from the header. For example, if you add `<#d#>` in the **Add header** field, the URL of that discussion will be added to the header of all the available messages in that discussion.

**Default**: None

**Example**:

```shell
DISCUSSION_ADD_HEADERS=headername1:value1, name2: value2 , post-id:<#n#>, forum-url:<#d#>, message-url:<#m#>, domain:<#h#>, list-name:<#l#>, list-address:<#l#>@<#h#>
````

**Comments**: Add one or more header names. The match of any of these headers in an outgoing message (via email) causes its addition with appropriate notification to the posting user.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DISCUSSION_DROP_MIME_TYPES

The `DISCUSSION_DROP_MIME_TYPES` token allows you to delete the mime types submitted by email that contain arbitrary strings. 

**Values**: image/jpeg,image/jpg,text/xml

**Default**: Regular expression

**Example**:

```shell
DISCUSSION_DROP_MIME_TYPES=image/jpeg,image/jpg,text/xml
````

**Comments**: Add one or more mime types to the Drop mime types filter. The presence of any of these mime types in an incoming message (via email) causes its deletion with appropriate notification to the posting user. If a mime type is specified in both the Reject and Drop mime filters, then the Reject mime type filter must take higher precedence than the Drop mime type filter.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DISCUSSION_EMAIL_MONITORING

The `DISCUSSION_EMAIL_MONITORING` token determines which users can monitor a forum on the site.

**Values**:

The `DISCUSSION_FORUM_EDITOR` token allows you to choose the type of text that can be used in discussion forum description using the editor tool.

**Values**: Plain Text

**Default**: Plain Text
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DISCUSSION_MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE {#DISCUSSION_MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE}

The `DISCUSSION_MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE` token sets an upper limit to the size of files that users can attach to an email message sent to any discussion forum on the site.

**Values**: Integer (Megabytes)

**Default**: blank

{% include note.html content="The content entry is case sensitive." %}
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## DISCUSSION_REJECT_HEADERS

The `DISCUSSION_REJECT_HEADERS` token allows you to block different headers submitted by email that contain arbitrary strings.

**Values**: Regular expression

**Default**: None

**Example**:
```shell
DISCUSSION_REJECT_HEADERS=(?s).*headername1:value2.*,(?s).*name2:value2.*
````

**Comments**: Add one or more header names. Each regular expression must match an entire header name. The match of any of these headers in an incoming message (via email)causes its rejection, with appropriate notification to the posting user.

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DISPLAY_TIMEZONE {#displaytimezone}

The `DISPLAY_TIMEZONE` token, if set with a preferred time zone, takes precedence over the physical TeamForge server location's time zone and will be the default time zone that's displayed throughout the application. In other words, use this token to set a preferred time zone to display across the TeamForge application in case the TeamForge physical server and users are not on the same time zone.

**Values**:
The ID for a time zone can be either a full name such as America/Los_Angeles, or a custom ID in the form GMT[+|-]hh[[:]mm] such as GMT-08:00. It can also be in the form of a three letter abbreviation such as PST.

**Default**: 
If set, this token overrides the default time zone of the TeamForge server. TeamForge uses the default time zone of the JVM otherwise.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}
 
## DOCUMENT_MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE {#DOCUMENT_MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE}

By default, you can upload documents of any size in TeamForge. The `DOCUMENT_MAX_FILE_UPLOAD_SIZE` token sets an upper limit to the size of the documents that can be uploaded. Use this token only if you want to restrict the size of the documents. 

**Values**: Integer (specify the number of Megabytes without the suffix `MB`)

**Default**: blank

**Comments**: 
A value of zero specifies that there is no limit, which is the same as the default behavior without the token. In other words, disabling this token, setting a value of 0, or leaving it blank sets the maximum file upload size to unlimited.

**Values**: Java specifications

**Default**: 

`ELASTICSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`

**Comments**:
<!-- (See: https://forge.collab.net/sf/go/artf300770) -->
As a result of changes to the logging framework in Java, the `PrintGCDetails` and `PrintGCTimeStamps` logging options are no longer supported. Remove these options from the following tokens while upgrading to TeamForge 18.1 or later.

* JBOSS_JAVA_OPTS
* PHOENIX_JAVA_OPTS
* INTEGRATION_JAVA_OPTS
* ETL_JAVA_OPTS
* ELASTICSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS
   
TeamForge provision fails on sites that use these options post upgrade to TeamForge 18.1 or later.

* New tokens, `ELASTICSEARCH_MIN_HEAP_SIZE` and `ELASTICSEARCH_MAX_HEAP_SIZE`, have been added in TeamForge 22.0, which are to be configured along with the  `ELASTICSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS` token. 
* Do not specify the minimum and maximum heap size in `ELASTICSEARCH_JAVA_OPTS`. Use `ELASTICSEARCH_MIN_HEAP_SIZE` and `ELASTICSEARCH_MAX_HEAP_SIZE` tokens instead. 
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## ELASTICSEARCH_MIN_HEAP_SIZE {#esminheap}

The `ELASTICSEARCH_MIN_HEAP_SIZE` token specifies the minimum memory settings for the Java virtual machine that supports Elasticsearch, used by TeamForge Code Search.

**Values**: Java specifications

**Default**: `-Xms2g`

{% include note.html content="By default, Elasticsearch JVM minimum heap size is set to 2GB in TeamForge. You can increase this, if required." %}
## ELASTICSEARCH_MAX_HEAP_SIZE {#esmaxheap}

The `ELASTICSEARCH_MAX_HEAP_SIZE` token specifies the maximum memory settings for the Java virtual machine that supports Elasticsearch, used by TeamForge Code Search.

**Values**: Java specifications

**Default**: `-Xmx2g`

{% include note.html content="By default, Elasticsearch JVM maximum heap size is set to 2GB in TeamForge. You can increase this, if required." %}
 
## ENABLE_BCC_MONITORING

When a work item such as an artifact or discussion is updated, instead of sending separate monitoring emails to all monitoring users, you can now choose to have just one monitoring email sent with all monitoring users added to the BCC. This reduces the load on the email server and results in faster email delivery. Set `ENABLE_BCC_MONITORING` to `true` to enable this feature.

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: false

**Comments**: 
Depending on your site's requirements, you can also optimize the value of `BCC_MAIL_BATCH_SIZE` to increase or decrease the number of emails delivered in a single delivery.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## FORBIDDEN_PASSWORD
The `FORBIDDEN_PASSWORD` token restricts specified words from being used as passwords.

**Values**: Comma-separated strings

**Default**: None
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_DATABASE_HOST
This is the Gerrit Postgres database host. The Gerrit configuration property, database.hostname, is derived from the value of `GERRIT_DATABASE_HOST` token in the `runtime-options.conf`. It can be overridden in `site-options.conf` and requires runtime creation with execution of the post installation script.

**Default**: 127.0.0.1
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_DATABASE_NAME
This refers the Gerrit database schema. The Gerrit configuration property, database.database, is derived from the value of `GERRIT_DATABASE_NAME` in `runtime-options.conf`. It can be overridden in `site-options.conf` and requires runtime creation with execution of post installation script.

**Default**: reviewdb
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_DATABASE_USER
This is the PostgresDB role name that has access to the Gerrit database `GERRIT_DATABASE_NAME`. The Gerrit configuration property, `database.username`, is derived from the value of `GERRIT_DATABASE_USER` in the `runtime-options.conf`. It can be overridden in `site-options.conf` and requires runtime creation with execution of post installation script.

**Default**: gerrit
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_GIT_PUSH_THRESHOLD {#gitpushthreshold}

The `GERRIT_GIT_PUSH_THRESHOLD` token determines the maximum number of commits in a single Git push. If the limit exceeds, only a single commit object is created in the TeamForge.

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_REPLICATION_MODE
Use this site-options token to set the Git integration server as either `master` or `slave` server. In case you do not want replication (standalone mode) or you have only one primary source for repositories, set this token to master. On the other hand, if you have a master Git integration server and you want to replicate (mirror) its repositories on a secondary slave Git integration server, set this token to slave on the slave Git integration server.

**Values**: master or slave

**Default**: master

**Comments**: 
By default, in TeamForge 8.1 (and later), this token is set to master in the `runtime-options.conf` during runtime creation. As you cannot change the replication mode of a Git server after initial runtime creation, you have to set this to slave at the very beginning of your installation process in case you want to configure the server as a mirror of a `master` Git server. It is not possible to have a Git master and slave configured on the same node, but you can have multiple masters and slaves in your TeamForge environment. Each slave belongs to exactly one master. Once a replica server is set up, it is not possible to reassign it to a different master Git integration server at a later point in time.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_REPLICATION_MASTER_EXTERNAL_SYSTEM_ID
If `GERRIT_REPLICATION_MODE` is set to `slave`, this token specifies external system ID of the `master` Git integration server.

**Values**: Alphanumeric string (exsy\<number>) of a master Git integration server

**Comments**:
This token is mandatory if `GERRIT_REPLICATION_MODE` is set to `slave`, without which the runtime creation shall fail. On the contrary, the runtime recreation will also fail if `GERRIT_REPLICATION_MODE` is set to `master` and this token is present in the `site-options.conf` file.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_SMTP_SERVER
This is the hostname of the SMTP mail server for Gerrit. The Gerrit configuration property, `sendmail.smtpServer`, is derived from the value of `GERRIT_SMTP_SERVER` in the `runtime-options.conf`. It can be overridden in `site-options.conf` and requires runtime creation with execution of post installation script.

**Default**: localhost
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_SYNCH_PORT
The Port over which TeamForge communicates to Gerrit. The Gerrit configuration property, `teamforge.apiPort`, is derived from the value of `GERRIT_SYNCH_PORT` in the `runtime-options.conf`. It can be overridden in `site-options.conf` and requires runtime creation with execution of post installation script.

**Default**: 9081
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## GERRIT_USER_EMAIL {#gerrituseremail}

**Values**:

**Default**: 

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## HAPROXY_HTTP_REUSE_OPTION {#HAPROXY_HTTP_REUSE_OPTION}

This token is used to declare how idle HTTP connections can be shared between requests. The default value is `safe`, which ensures that in case the backend server closes the connection when the request is being sent, the browser silently retries to keep the connection alive.

**Values**: never/safe/aggressive/always

**Default**: safe

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## HIGHCHARTS_EXPORT_REQUEST_MAX_WAIT
This token is used to set the number of milliseconds that the Highcharts web application has to wait for response from the phantomjs server before it times out.

TeamForge chart export feature requires a pool of phantomjs servers to be running in the application server that is managed by a Highcharts web application. The phantomjs server pool runs as a blocking queue.

This token is used to specify the number of milliseconds that the Highcharts web application has to wait before it times out. In other words, the phantomjs server is expected to respond to the Highcharts web application within the time limit (in milliseconds) set in `HIGHCHARTS_EXPORT_REQUEST_MAX_WAIT`.

**Default**: 500 milliseconds

This token was added in TeamForge 7.2.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## HIGHCHARTS_EXPORT_REQUEST_POOL_SIZE

## LOGIN_ATTEMPT_LOCK {#LOGIN_ATTEMPT_LOCK}
This option controls locking out the user account after "n" invalid login attempts.
* Set this to zero or a negative number to lock the user account when the user provides an incorrect password for the first time.
* Set this to a positive number, say "2", to allow the user two wrong password attempts. The user account would be locked at the "x+1" (here, third) attempt. 

When a user's account is locked, either an administrator must unlock it or the user can use the "Forgot Your Password?" link to reset the password.
 
You must set the `REQUIRE_PASSWORD_SECURITY` token to `true` in the `site-options.conf` file, for `LOGIN_ATTEMPT_LOCK` setting to take effect.
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## LISTEN_IP
In a distributed setup, you can use this `<host>:<service>:LISTEN_IP` token to control which IPs the services bind to so that you can make sure that services are not overexposed than necessary.

By default, services bind to the IP address corresponding to the `<host>:PUBLIC_FQDN` token. However, you can override this using the `<host>:<service>:LISTEN_IP` token.

A few use cases:
* In a distributed setup, you may want to bind a particular IP address of the TeamForge database server (PostgreSQL server) to the `ctfcore-database` service:
  ```shell
  server-01:ctfcore-database:LISTEN_IP = 1.2.3.4
  ````
* To bind the mail service to a particular IP:
  ```shell
  localhost:mail:LISTEN_IP = 1.2.3.4
  ````
* To make TeamForge listen to a specific IP of a particular server, say the SCM server:
  ```shell
  myscmserver:LISTEN_IP = 1.2.3.4
  ````
* To bind all your services to one IP address (typically in a single server setup):
  ```shell
  localhost:LISTEN_IP = 1.2.3.4

## LOG_QUERY_TIME_THRESHOLD {#LOG_QUERY_TIME_THRESHOLD}
The `LOG_QUERY_TIME_THRESHOLD` token enables you to log database requests at INFO level if they run longer than a given period.

By default, database requests are logged at DEBUG level. Configuring a value for `LOG_QUERY_TIME_THRESHOLD` causes requests that run for a period greater than that value to be logged at the INFO level in the `/opt/collabnet/teamfoge/log/apps/query.log` file.

Set the value to zero to log all database queries at INFO.

**Values**: Integer (milliseconds)

**Default**: 1000
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## LOGIN_ATTEMPT_LOCK
Use the `LOGIN_ATTEMPT_LOCK` token to set the permissible number of unsuccessful login attempts after which the user account is automatically locked.

**Values**: 1-3

Important: You can now selectively disable this feature even if you have set the `REQUIRE_PASSWORD_SECURITY` site options token to `true`. Set any negative value (such as '-1' or '-10000') in case you want to disable this feature altogether.

Note that with TeamForge 8.1 and earlier versions, setting `LOGIN_ATTEMPT_LOCK=-1` means the user account would be locked at the very first unsuccessful login attempt. This behavior has been removed in TeamForge 8.2 (and later).

**Default**: 3

The `PASSWORD_CONTROL_EFFECTIVE_DATE` token is used to set the date from which the password security feature takes effect.

**Values**: Date (mm/dd/yyyy)

**Comments**:
The [REQUIRE_PASSWORD_SECURITY][siteoptiontokens.html#REQUIRE_PASSWORD_SECURITY] is the master token that enables the password security feature.

{% include important.html content="Setting the `PASSWORD_CONTROL_EFFECTIVE_DATE` token with a date is mandatory if `REQUIRE_PASSWORD_SECURITY` is set to `true`." %}

**Example 1**:

Consider a site with 130 users on which the password control kit (PCK) was not active. Of the 130 users, assume that:
* 100 users did not change password in last 100 days.
* 20 users did not change password in last 85 days.
* 10 users did not change password in last 75 days.

Assume that the following tokens are set on 01/01/2014 (current date):
```conf
REQUIRE_PASSWORD_SECURITY=true
PASSWORD_WARNING_PERIOD=20
PASSWORD_EXPIRY_PERIOD=90
PASSWORD_DISABLE_PERIOD=30
PASSWORD_DELETE_PERIOD=60
````

PCK runs on 01/01/2014 and if you have `PASSWORD_CONTROL_EFFECTIVE_DATE=01/10/2014` (set to a future date):
* 100 users with no password change for the past 100 days would get a warning message that their passwords will expire in 10 days.
* 20 users with no password change for the past 85 days would get a warning message that their passwords will expire in 10 days.
* 10 users with no password change for the past 75 days would get a warning message that their passwords will expire in 15 days.

**Example 2**:
Consider the following scenario in which:
* Current date = 01/01/2014
* PASSWORD_CONTROL_EFFECTIVE_DATE=01/01/2013

In this scenario, the password control effective date is set to a date in the past. As a result, password control takes immediate effect and the PCK starts disabling, deleting or expiring user accounts right away.

The `SOAP_ARTIFACT_LIST_LIMIT` token is used to limit the number of artifacts returned via SOAP calls.

**Values**: Integer

**Default**: -1

This means that the artifact list retrieved via SOAP is unlimited.

**Comments**: 
In TeamForge releases earlier than 6.1.1, SOAP calls returned everything that was asked for, and that is the default behavior in TeamForge 6.1.1 as well. However, sites with performance and stability issues (OutOfMemory errors) in returning a large number of artifacts can now limit the number using this token. Changing this value requires a recreate-runtime and thus a site restart.

**Default**: `root@{__APPLICATION_HOST__}`

{% include important.html content="In TeamForge 6.x, the sender name and address for system-generated emails is taken from the value of the `SYSTEM_EMAIL` token. Therefore, changing the admin user's full name or email address does not affect the sender details of system-generated emails. This is different from TeamForge 5.x, in which the sender name and address for system-generated emails is derived from the admin user's full name and email address." %}
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## USE_BROWSER_CACHE_PASSWORD
The `USE_BROWSER_CACHE_PASSWORD` token restricts the storage of password in the browser when you login to the site.

{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## USE_STATIC_SENDER_EMAIL
<!-- https://forge.collab.net/sf/go/artf269719 -->
The `USE_STATIC_SENDER_EMAIL` token, if set to `true`, assigns the `Return-Path` parameter in the TeamForge notification email header with a `noreply@<user's email domain>` email ID. This prevents Out of Office replies from being posted to artifacts and discussion forums.

On the other hand, the `USE_STATIC_SENDER_EMAIL` token, if set to `false`, assigns the `Return-Path` parameter in the TeamForge notification email header with the email ID of the user (for example, tom@forge.collab.net) whose action triggers the notification email. In this case, Out of Office replies are posted to artifacts and discussion forums. If the user is a Site Administrator, the `Return-Path` parameter in the TeamForge notification email header is assigned with the email ID `root@<TeamForge domain name>`.

**Values**: true or false

**Default**: false
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## USER_ACCOUNT_RESTRICTED

## Using Multi-line Blocks for Site Options
The multi-line block configuration is generally used by old SFEE sites. To define a `site-options.conf` token with a multi-line block value, you need to follow a certain syntax.

* Declare the token name with the value `START_MULTILINE_BLOCK`. Syntax: `<TOKEN_NAME>=START_MULTILINE_BLOCK`
* Specify the multi-line values beneath the token.
* Complete the multi-line block with `END_MULTILINE_BLOCK` after all the multi-line values are specified. Syntax: `END_MULTILINE_BLOCK`

**Example**:

```shell
SOURCEFORGE_CONFIGURATION_PROPERTIES_APPEND=START_MULTILINE_BLOCK
email.suppress.project_member_added=true
email.suppress.scm_user_password_synchronized=true
END_MULTILINE_BLOCK
````

## WEBR_HTTP_BINDNAME {#WEBR_HTTP_BINDNAME}
<!-- Artifact artf394921 : Doc update : two new webr site options tokens -->
WEBR is, by default, bound to port 3000 and https. However, you can bind the WEBR service to http and to any other port of choice. Use the WEBR_HTTP_BINDNAME token to bind WEBR to any http port of choice. 

Here's an example of how to bind WEBR to port 3009.

```shell
WEBR_HTTP_BINDNAME=:3009
WEBR_HTTP_BINDNAME=localhost:3009
````
{{site.data.alerts.hr_shaded}}

## WEBR_INIT_JSFILE {#WEBR_INIT_JSFILE}
<!-- https://forge.collab.net/sf/go/artf394874#3 -->
Use this token to load an initial Javascript (JS) file to the WEBR's native JS virtual machine. The initial JS file configured via this token is executed first before the subscription script. 

The use case is to load a script to the JS VM that any script can have access to. For example, you can load a script that has a few variable definitions and make the variables commonly available to all other scripts.

Here's an example. 

```shell
WEBR_INIT_JSFILE=./initialJSfile.js
````
**An Illustration**

1. Create an `init.js` file in current directory with the following content:
   ```js
   var custname = "umakanthan";
   var othername = $inmessage.Name;
   ````
2. Add the WEBR_INIT_JSFILE token to the `site-options.conf` file as:
   ```shel
   WEBR_INIT_JSFILE=./init.js
   ````
3. Create a subscription with the following subscription script:
   ```shell
   $outmessage = 'My name is Uma,'+ custname + ' ' + othername;
   ````
4. Send a message to the Sync event with following payload:
   ```json
   {
   	"Name": "uma111"
   }
   ````

   Here's the response you get:

   ```shell
   My name is Uma, umakanthan uma111
   ````

   {% include note.html content="The init code is run just after creating the $inmessage and other internal variables. So these should be accessible inside the init script." %}
